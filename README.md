# Text-to-Braille-Converter

1. Project Description:
   Developed an Arduino-based system that translates English alphabet text into Braille script, catering to the needs of visually impaired individuals. The system utilizes a combination of tactile feedback and audio cues to enhance accessibility and communication for the visually impaired.

2. Purpose and Significance:
   Designed the project with the primary goal of fostering inclusivity by providing an innovative solution for the visually impaired community. The device converts digital text into Braille, offering a practical and portable means for individuals with visual impairments to access written information independently. This aligns with a commitment to leveraging technology for social impact and addressing accessibility challenges.

3. Technical Implementation:
   Employed Arduino programming and hardware components to create a user-friendly interface that takes English text as input and outputs the corresponding Braille representation. Integrated tactile feedback mechanisms for real-time interaction and an audio output feature for enhanced usability. This project showcases proficiency in hardware programming, problem-solving, and a dedication to creating solutions with a positive impact on society.

4. Need:
   Braille is universal and available in every language in the world, including Esperanto. It is currently used by six million blind people around the world.
